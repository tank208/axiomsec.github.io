  <h2>Mission: Bridging Critical Gaps</h2>
  <div class="background-story">
    <p>
      <strong>Workforce Development Challenge:</strong> Cybersecurity professionals increasingly need industrial control systems knowledge to protect critical infrastructure, but traditional education creates barriers for non-electrical students.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>My Unique Solution:</strong> Combine industry experience with academic rigor to create educational approaches that work in real-world contexts. Faculty recognize this perspective as valuable because it addresses practical implementation challenges that pure academic approaches might miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Graduate School Vision:</strong> Advance cybersecurity education methodology research while maintaining industry perspective. Goal is to systematically address workforce development challenges through evidence-based curriculum design and deployment strategies.
